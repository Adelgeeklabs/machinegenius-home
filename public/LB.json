She later disclosed that she mentally prepared for the worst-case scenario, believing she might be assaulted or murdered. Thankfully, she survived; nevertheless, the aftermath of the ordeal transformed her existence. Since then, she has been markedly more private regarding her jewelry and whereabouts (because, duh), demonstrating that even someone like Kim Kardashian is not beyond reach. The trauma continues to haunt her, influencing the way she interacts with social media and presents herself in public today.",
